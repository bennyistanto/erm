# Novelty, limitation and constraint

## Novelty

- Use forecast and near real time data instead of monitoring data for developing flood alert
- Use free public data for both historical data and forecasts
- Simple output (yes or no / flood or no flood)
- Analysis of critical rainfall (threshold) is conducted by pixels, in area with spatial resolution 0.1deg x 0.1deg ~ 10km x 10km

## Limitation and constraints

- Complex issues of hydrology, river flow and conditions (e.g catchment) are still excluded
- ERM only able monitor or predict flood caused by extreme rainfall in a location where extreme rainfall occurred. And unable to calculate flood caused by runoff accumulation from other areas.
