# Extreme rainfall monitoring, will it trigger a flood?

## Welcome

This is a fork repository from https://github.com/wfpidn/ERM which originally I wrote it during my service with WFP, and since I left the agency this guideline no longer maintained. So I will continue to update this at my personal Github repo.

Extreme Rainfall Monitoring (ERM) is an experimental tool developed by the United Nations [World Food Programme](https://www.wfp.org/countries/indonesia) in Indonesia written in [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com) (GEE) platform. ERM are able to inform where is the estimated location of extreme rainfall and its impact to population and crop in the last 5-days and forecast up to 5-days ahead based on selected date.

Some of the input was prepared via different platform: ArcGIS Pro, R Statistics, and Excel. ERM module is part of Vulnerability Analysis and Monitoring Platform for Impact of Regional Events ([VAMPIRE](http://vampire.pulselabjakarta.org) - now called PRISM) hazard monitoring module. Some of the analysis has been modified and adjusted to GEE based on data availability and considering the computation resources within GEE. While the methodology written in this document still reflecting what we developed in VAMPIRE.

This is the single-source documentation for ERM. It is intended to be a thorough, living document detailing the background, objective, data, method and output of ERM. If you find a mistake, please open an issue.

ERM model developed by Benny Istanto and [Prof. Rizaldi Boer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=jTPXEp8AAAAJ) of Climatology Laboratory - [Bogor Agricultural University](https://ipb.ac.id) as Scientific Advisor.
