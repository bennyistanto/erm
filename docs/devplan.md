# Summary

We have some plan to improve the capabilities of PRISM/VAMPIRE by adding some features on the platform, including the ERM hazard module.

The work in progress at the moment is:

**[Landslide monitoring and early warning](../ls/)**
: We try to utilized the alert generated by extreme rainfall and combining with NASA's LHASA to identify potential landslides that often go undetected and unreported.


**[Surface runoff accumulation](../runoff/)**
: As ERM only able monitor or predict flood caused by extreme rainfall in a location where extreme rainfall occurred, and unable to calculate flood caused by runoff accumulation from other areas. We plan to solve this problem with an approach through surface runoff accumulation calculations. 

We think both activities are do able using GEE.
